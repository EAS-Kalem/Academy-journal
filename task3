Task 3 My responsibility - Set up DNS

On this task only the Max and Kaine have an IP address to find the VMs with IPs
nmap 192.168.1.0/24 -p 22       (Find IPs on the network, found 192.168.1.150)
     
ssh user@192.168.1.150          (Get into the first system using ssh)
    

dnf install dhcp-server         (Install dhcp server on 192.168.1.150 to distribute IPs)


vi /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf         (Configure DHCP conf files)

systemctl start dhcpd           (Start DHCP file)
systemctl status dhcpd          (Check status of DHCP)
    

DHCP server gave all VMs a IP
    
ssh user@10.0.0.10          (SSH into our individual VMs using dynamic IP)
    
vi /etc/sysconfig/network-script/ifcfg-ens160       (Set IP to static using the network scripts file)
    
ifdown ens160 && ifup ens160

dnf install bind bind-utils             (Download packages for DNS)
    
systemctl enable named                  (enable the DNS)
systemctl status named                  (check the status of dns)

vi /etc/named.conf                      (Configure DNS and add .localhost to allow query)
    
vi /var/named/easlab.co.uk.db           (Create the forward zone file with hostnames )
    
vi /var/named/10.0.0.db                 (Create the reverse zone file with hostnames )

systemctl restart named                 (Restart the DNS)
systemctl status named                  (Check the status of DNS)
    

Now the DNS was working and everyone on the network could ping eachother and ping google

Now Max had to run a http server to distribute app.zip files

wget http://max/app3.zip        (Pull app2.zip file onto my system)
    

unzip app2.zip                    (Unzip zip file to view contents)

vi index.js                         (Check index.js is passing Data correctly)
    

node index.js &                     (This allows me to run index.js in the background so i could run curl commands and check the chain)

curl http://app1                    (Run a curl command to test that the links are working)

    We configured firewalls to allow port 80 and we were able to run the apps and have them link correctly.

    We could check this by opening a browser window and going to the ingress IP of 192.168.1.150
    This gave as the status check of each app and linked to the 6th app on Andrews system.
